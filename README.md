# Program Manager

Launch programs from one place.

Program Manager can run Python, Batch, VBS, and Executable Scripts.

Automatically runs on startup (remove the `os.system()` function at the start of the program if you don't want to run on startup)

All programs or shortcuts must be in a `Programs` folder.
